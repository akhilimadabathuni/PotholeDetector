# AI Pothole Detection for Road Safety

**A Python application to identify and track road potholes from a video feed using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.**

</div>

---

### **✨ Key Features**
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Processes video streams to find potholes.
- **High Accuracy:** Uses a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for reliable detection.
- **Video Output:** Generates a new video file with bounding boxes drawn around detections.
- **Extensible:** Can be trained to detect other road hazards like cracks or debris.

### **🚀 Quick Start Guide**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running.

**1. Set Up Your Environment**
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: Make sure to create a requirements.txt file with ultralytics, opencv-python, etc.)

2. Train the AI Model
You must train the model on a labelled dataset first.

# Start training using your data.yaml file
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640

This process will generate your custom model (best.pt) inside the runs/ directory.

3. Run the Detector
Execute the main script with your trained model and a video file.

python main.py --model "runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt" --video "path/to/your/video.mp4"

The final processed video will be saved as output_video.mp4.
